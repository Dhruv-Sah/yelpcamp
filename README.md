# YelpCamp
YelpCamp is a website where users can review or search for campgrounds. To review a campground simply sign up. Users can add, edit, remove, and rate campgrounds. They can also edit and remove reviews.  

I created this website with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap. Passport.js was used to handle authentication.
